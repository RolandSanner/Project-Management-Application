      <h2>Jack Khodr</h2>
      <p>
        Jack Khodr's civil engineering and project management background has
        shaped him into a problem solver, and finding solutions to other
        people's problems is a passion. Integrating both those skills into
        coding came both generic and natural. Jack love listening to podcasts
        and audiobooks, the wisdom and knowledge gained have been indispensable.
        Sir Isaac Newton once said, If I have seen further, it is by standing on
        the shoulders of giants. Having access to the minds of great thinkers
        and leaders has opened Jack's eyes to how essential technology has been
        in reducing the friction in propagating information around the world.
